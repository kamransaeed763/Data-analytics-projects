# Clinical Biomarker & Treatment Response Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **clinical data analysis and visualization dashboard** focused on inflammatory biomarkers and treatment outcomes across multiple disease categories. The analysis explores biomarker distributions, treatment usage patterns, response outcomes, relapse rates, and correlations to support data-driven insights in biomedical and clinical research.

The dashboard was designed using **Microsoft Excel** with advanced charting and descriptive analytics, making it accessible for clinicians, researchers, and data analysts.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes the following analytical components:

### 🔬 Biomarker Analysis
- Distribution of **IL-6**, **TNF-α**, and **CRP** levels across the study population
- Comparative distribution of **IL-6 levels by disease type**
- Identification of variability and outliers in inflammatory markers

### 💊 Treatment Analysis
- Count of treatments across all disease categories
- Distribution of treatment responses (Complete, Partial, No Response)
- **Relapse rates by treatment type**

### 🔗 Correlation Analysis
- Heatmap showing correlations between:
  - IL-6
  - TNF-α
  - CRP  
- Helps identify relationships between inflammatory biomarkers
